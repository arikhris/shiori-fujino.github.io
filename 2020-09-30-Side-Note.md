My break-down only comes from one thing. I often am obsessively delusional that something or someone try to harm me. I hate bullies, more than anything.

I spent my teenager alone. Girls avoided me because of my broken family. My parents got divorce when I was little and I don't know, girls just hated me. I guess it's from jealousy as well because my parents were sorry for their divorce so they bought me whatever I wanted. I wore fancy cloths and shoes, had always the newest phones and music players. It got stolen or I found in toilet and bins many times but I couldn't do anything about it. They must be unhappy about me often skip the school because I was preparing my portfolio for art school whereas others stayed at school study until late night. They didn't bash me or abuse me directly though it was horrible to be alone at all time. No one wanted to sit next to me when it's lunchtime and I always went to school alone, came back home after school.

First few years, I was upset. I blamed my parents. and then I was getting a little annoyed. Annoyed by those unspecified individuals. I didn't understand what made them to dislike me. Next step I got angry. So I started bully them back. Wanna fight me one on one? that's fair. One on crowd is never right. Plus, I didn't do anything wrong. I can't list everything I did but if they did one I countered back three. I made few girls cry and they hated me even more time after time. I didn't even go to graduation party. I celebrated myself that finally, I am away from tiresome loneliness in crowd.

Thus, I hate bullies desperately. Who ever does like bullies? but for me it's another level of hate. I can't just ignore bullies. I tried to ignore and did my things earlier, and they looked down on me more and more. They started to think that It's ok to bully me because I didn't do anything about it. I had to attack them twice harder so they scared of me, and never bully me again. I don't like being doormat, I will never let them bully me again, it's enough.

When I thought about ending game, It was very comforting, it was relief. I imagine a terribly disappointed bullies. It was a cathartic. In my mind,
>Now you all have to find another victim instead of me. Look at this blood and dead body, Are you all happy? I am sorry for your loss, You all lost your great fun :p byeee

This is how I contrived the *hammer-skull-smashed-pumpkin* method. I had to imagine the most grotesque scene. A lot of blood, much gory details about the broken skull. It has to Shock bullies, I wanted them to be mental too after seeing my mashed ~~potato~~brain. Then, I got my mind strike in a flash sometimes. I was frightened of myself that I was comforting myself in this way. I could kill myself instantly. I hate to be a victim, I would rather end my life than be a victim. I hate it that much.

It was nuts, I was mess. I don't have many friends to ask about it. When I asked few people, answers were same.
- Delete everything and install again
- Don't think too much.

It wasn't helpful at all.
