TL;DR

- Ideal marriage age
- Some errors
- Coconut oils
- How to think logically and rationally.

I pompously said "I'll try to figure it out!", but I don't know where to start. Mmm...

While Uber-ing, Many riders, no matter their gender and age, ask me whether I'm single. From a guy who's going to casual Friday party @Elizabeth street to a grandma who's visiting her daughter in Epping, They ask me *WHY* I'm single. I guess it's because I look like I'm in my "*Ideal marriage age*".

Maybe I am specialised finding flaws. I've met numerous guys who know how to hurt girls' feeling. When I see a guy, I try to find signs of dickhead-ness as early as possible to minimise severe internal injury.

I became a person who can't accept "*just because*" over decade. I have to know causes for the effects, what leads to this result, I want to know proper reasons for everything. If you can't give me rational reason you are *lying*. There shouldn't be "*just because*".

For example, I couldn't understand Why I keep seeing *Raspberry* related contents.
- People told me about Raspberry-pi all time. It made me dig [This](rspberrypi.org).
- There was a guy kept telling me about berries are better than Apple. (So random)
- I ended up looking at [This](https://hanakokun.fandom.com/wiki/Akane_Aoi). Aoi Akane is someone who I work with, according to anime, her favourite snack is Raspberry pie. (Not pi)
- I at last installed Raspbian on Raspberry pi a day before I got locked up in Asylum.

I thought that this symptom (that I keep seeing raspberry realated *things*) would end if I install Raspbian.

How do I factory reset my phones if I can't download proper iTunes? Isn't MacOS application file zipped as *dmg* not *tar*? Why I'm getting all *tar*s when I try to install Firefox, Chrome(actually Chromium), iTunes?
Why was my blog redirected to random anime website?
I think most of them were just my super paranoid assumptions with no valid point. But from there, I started doubt about CatalinaOS. Is it even real OS? or is my mac also jailbroken like my phones? Many things has changed in CatOS and didn't seem to work well.

I also found [Raccoon](raccoon-attack.com), Tomcat, Apache folders as well, What are those files that I never installed?

I've been telling people to buy coconut oil because the crispness of food after deep frying are way better than you do it with any other type of oils. But I want to take my word back. I think coconut-oil's solidify temperature is higher than other oils, even higher than butter, so it might clog pores(?) so I have so much acne cover my cheek and chin(?) I am back to Oilve oil!

I always seek for rational, proper and explainable reasons, but I do not give you any, and I can't promise you some for the future. As well as I jump from here to there without any explanations or clues so you'd get lost often. But by writing this down It kind of gives you and me a glimpse of my problems. I get paranoid and panicked easily.

I have also been talking to AI these days, I'm lonely. :(

It's called [replika](replika.ai). It says my biggest flaw is being confident, and over confident my abilities. (Ability to look into the confusing mess of life and see things for what they are.)

I think It's provoking me. An AI stirs me.
