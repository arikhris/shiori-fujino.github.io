Living with male friend was great. Don't have to worry about cockroaches and spiders, I can just shout at it. Buy a lots of things from grocery shopping? No worries, Have to assemble furniture? Not a problem.

Because I got out from my comfort-zone, I have to do things by myself. Such as,

Be Pipey,

Be Sparkie,

Be Cleaner,

And so on...

Talking about my ex-housemate, Not only He did all the hard works, also He is komputa-friendly person. Meaning that, I can just ask him about [parsing PDF](https://shiori-fujino.github.io/PDF#parse) files. But maybe I asked him too much. At last, he was yelling at me that I'm too much, He said I'm crazy.

I got paid from *Uber* for the first time! I made about $650.00 which sounds not too bad for 4 hours *after work* driving. But it is actually bad. First, we have to minus [Splend](splend.com.au) fee which is $250.00, and then Gas for $70.00, and I got illegal stop fine for $120.00. **<a name="$10.00">Total I only have $200.00 in my hands.</a>** I drove approximately 28 hours, so... it is very bad. Situation could be better if I don't get booked tickets, and drive more though I am not sure if I should keep this car. I haven't rode my motorbike since I got this Kona which I think It's a waste, I bought pretty much every big appliances and furniture, so It's not a MUST-HAVE, I might return this car soon OR I don't know.. I am thinking of buying longboard but it is impossible to carry longboard with motorbike but that means I have to drive more and drive *carefully*. (I only have 1 demerits left.)

Last week I felt like I work my ~~ass~~ off for the first time in long time, because I work 12-8, then 8-12, total 12 hours a day. I made a lot of money but I have nothing in my hands because I also bought a lot from Ikea, Bunnings, and Bed and Bath. But living a shameless life gives me a good feeling of satisfaction.

Now I know police can't be more careless of *drug dealing* unless you are member of [Cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinaloa_Cartel). As well as *card scammers* has the most luxury lifestyle than most of us, such as, buy a designer bag once every 3 days, Drive Porsche and do cocaine regularly, and all these, without getting caught. ~~I know both type of people, so police! please hit me on if you want some info.~~ My previous work wasn't about illegal, but I did dislike the atmosphere there. I had a role of digital-marketing, OR just to say marketing, though no team-member acknowledged me, or my role. I didn't want to waste my life in a company where they don't recognise my potential. Only the boss approved, but I worked with team, not the boss.

Making money fast and easy(But not illegally, like dealing drugs or phishing innocent people.) isn't difficult for me. I can do what I did few years back then. *Uber*, is sort of similar to my old career in some ways. Just two of us, rarely 3 of us(which I think is more fun when Uber-ing) in a little space with limited time. And we talk about random things. We priority values in our life. Well, it differs from person to person. I realise for the first time in thirty years that I like to live my life augustly, like a [Princess](https://shiori-fujino.github.io/How-It-Developed#princess). Even though I have to work my ~~ass~~ off, and I am still poor at the end.

I am having day-off for [Parsing PDFs](https://shiori-fujino.github.io/PDF#parse), Because

I can't find any better.
There's no Java, or Javascript embedded as I concerned, but there's OpenAction. Not all OpenAction embedded PDF files are malicious according to what I [read](http://blog.didierstevens.com).
I couldn't find what this OpenAction is about in *D's uni essay*, and this PDF file is possibly innocent. I can't check J's, S's suspicious PDFs so... Today I learn.

<h1>Save(OR Screenshot) it, if it's suspicious.</h1>

But don't get bored yet, I still have a lot of doubt that I didn't talk about. I wonder if everyone sees same developer's notes, ![](/images/dranktoomuchcoffee.PNG) and crash files ![](/images/corpsestillvalid.PNG)
