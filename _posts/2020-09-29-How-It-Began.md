title: How It Began
---

I remember it was May. When New South Wales, Australia got into lockdown level 3,(or was it 4?) so everyone has to stay at home. I had a lot of time to play with my phone and internet because I lost my job. Fortunately I had a second job that I could make more money than my day job, so I quite enjoyed the lockdown.

I have been using yellow iPhone XR, since 2019. It's relatively new phone, so it should be working normal without lagging or getting bricked.(?)

I found something went to wrong though.

I forgot what it exactly was, I somehow ended up looking at my google search histories and there were some things that I didn't look up, and some things that I didn't install but it was installed in my phone through Safari. I only used Safari since it's default browser in my phone. I thought ðŸ¤” "hmm why" but didn't think much about how. I *guessed* that some apps needed to update itself or something. I didn't care much, I searched on google few hours but couldn't find similar issues.

I found many *.ru or .xyz or .ninja* domains that looks like not legit, but clickbait. Also I found many *Google books* results. All links that I clicked showed me very irrelevant context at the end. But I couldn't be more careless. If someone really hacks my phone, the first thing should be stealing money but money was bank app worked fine. It indeed annoyed me that some websites didn't work properly, some apps were so laggy. I didn't bother to care more until one day **the random image** pops up on my iPad all of sudden, out of no where, while I was browsing random stuff.

It was Shia LaBeouf's "Just do it" meme.

Yes I know, it's bizarre.

FYI, I have never done *Jailbreak* or anything similar because I'm not a komputa person. I've heard from people saying that the *Jailbreaking* is good because I can install many more apps for **FREE**. That means I don't have to pay *Grammarly* yearly, as well as *iCloud*, *Apple Music* kind of service that I'm paying for could be totally free.

Also, this is what I learnt recently by the way. People do Jailbreak their phone because they want *Privilege Escalation*. Although, I never thought that I want to do it because simply It looks too complicate to accomplish it to me, and the security vulnerability never appealed to me. I've been using banking app since long time ago and I never wanted to someone steal my money.

***But PayPal did it when it was 20..18. Someone used my PayPal account to spend $99 on google play store. PayPal said it's my fault that I never changed my password since the joining date. It's ridiculous.***

I was never interested those *komputa thing* because I don't understand the languages. I merely trusted what media and people say, Jailbreak is bad and Apple security is the best. No one can hack the iPhone, It's hard to hack apple OS. blah blah blah, yada yada yada.

At that time, I mean earlier of this year, I came across as a very **promiscuous** girl in the town, because... I was.
I had a blog that I wrote about sex, relationship, random thoughts, and about my previous work place which is taboo but not illegal. People were curious about this sex-friendly author and I didn't hate the attention, I was enjoying it until I met a stalker. Well he's more likely... Internet bully.

TL;DR
I found something weird from my phone and I told people about it, but no one listened to me carefully and I didn't care much either. And I was hypersexual, nymphomania.
