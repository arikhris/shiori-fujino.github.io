I am curious about the [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF). I google a lot. Because I don't know many things and [NAVER](naver.com) sometimes don't have much information about specific items. ~~For example, Ex's ABN.~~ Somehow I get a lot of google books results sometimes, and It can't be more irrelevant. For example, I was googling "*pdf attack*", and I got results of romance novels and textbook for medical school students. The other time I was googling "*my name*", and I got results of Indonesian government statics article and United States Marine Corps booklet. Those are in form of google books which was scanned, published as PDF. But anyway, I could manage not to see any more google books result. (I derived help from [HERE](https://support.google.com/websearch/thread/19228520?hl=en))

However, my ex housemate(I'll call him *S*.) and housemate's friend kept sending me a random PDFs. First few times I didn't care much about it and opened it carelessly. But one day, Ex housemate's friend(I'll name him *J* from now on.) sent me a very random PDF. It was about a random person's mushroom uses after reports.

??? It's suspicious. Isn't it? Let's dig in!

According to [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Viruses_and_exploits),
>One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack.

According to [Another random website](https://www.maketecheasier.com/malicious-pdf-files-you-should-not-open/),
>When you open the PDF file, the malicious javascript get executed and install malware on your computer, all without you knowing it. Many people don't pay enough attention to the fact that PDF files can contain viruses and open them without scanning them.

So It is not impossible to plant a virus or malware and exploit through PDFs. Oh! I forgot to mention, On 02/06/20, I searched one guy's name because he was hitting on me for a while. I didn't want to make another mistake so I did some preparatory research. And I found another PDF (It is he's essay, and I'll call him as D from now.) from unsecured website. Every PDF that I opened previously could possibly was javascript embedded file. I can't detect whether malicious js was embedded in *mushroom after report* from J, or *My previous work stock holder list* from S. However, I can try D's *uni essay* from unprotected website.

But wait, What is *unsecured website*?! What does "*Not secured*" website mean?

If you see a website is showing up as

![This](/images/notsecure.jpeg),

>Then it's missing an updated SSL certificate. This is easily recognizable in your website URL as it will start with HTTP instead of HTTPS. [Read more](https://www.awebco.com/blog/site-not-secure/)

It's funny because It's uni repository though it has not valid *Secured Socket Layer* certificate. PDF file from Not secured website... I am excited.

I want to know why a University website isn't secured, and if it's not secured for a reason, I wonder what they are collecting from visitor... But first things first. Let's learn how to scope PDF file, and How to know if a PDF file is infected.

According to [StackExchange](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/171716/how-to-know-if-a-pdf-file-is-infected),

 >The best way to find out would be to try to extract the javascript in question and see what it actually does without running it.

 Right, I need to **Parse a PDF file** and I don't even know what *Parse* means.

There are many ways to parse a PDF files.

 - PDF to Text
 - PDF to HTML
 - PDF to *XML* or *CSV*

 What are XML/CSV file?...
