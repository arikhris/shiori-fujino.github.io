title: Non-sponsored Promotional Post For Didi

<h3>Didi</h3>

Last night I got a message from Didi about driver promotion while I was upset about less than [ten dollars per hour](https://shiori-fujino.github.io/Handy-Woman#$10.00) driving with Uber. I didn't read it properly but I joined to be a Didi driver! :D I drove 5 hours today, Here's my thoughts about Didi.

* Easy account activation

  Compare to Uber took whole 2 weeks and gave me mental, I got approved within an hour. Required documents are same as Uber.

* Do I get paid more?

  Oh wow, actually, [Yes](https://australia.didiglobal.com/driver/didi-advance/). I felt like I get paid more than when I drive similar distance with Uber but it's a lot different. Uber takes 27.5% for service fee and Didi takes only 5%. ONLY FIVE PERCENTS!

- Do riders pay less?

  Yes, Definitely. Besides, they issue many coupons too. I don't know why people don't use Didi as much as they use Uber?! It's obviously a lot better for riders and drivers. Didi should promote more because riders told me it's hard to get a driver sometimes, so they have to use Uber because no choice.


  |              | Uber  | Didi  |
  |--------------|-------|-------|
  | Minimum fare | $9.00 | $8.45 |
  | Base fare    | $2.50 | $2.50 |
  | Per minute   | $0.40 | $0.37 |
  | Per km       | $1.45 | $1.33 |


People, please use Didi more! Let's not support Uber's monopoly of ride-share market. Didi's orange colour app might look a bit ugly compare to Uber's classy interface but does it matter?! and it's a personal thought, Didi as brand name isn't my taste. Maybe it's because of my previous work. I hated to name a girl as Didi, Cici, Bibi, Yiyi(or was it EE?), Gigi, Vivi, Mimi, Kiki, Fifi... But who cares! It pays more to drivers and cheaper for riders.

  Plus I can see where riders want to go before accept requests. Meaning that I can avoid long/shot trips if I want to. Whereas Uber only shows me destinations after I accept requests.


<h3>About Google Adsense.</h3>
 I tried to monetise my blog since 2015, but never was successful except donations from readers.(Total less than $100.00) I had few hundreds views everyday but couldn't make any money out of it because if you read Adsense's terms and conditions: My previous blog is a big no-no. Almost every contents were very sexual, It was not suitable for family. It was more X18+ rated than PG. I posted my naked selfies many times, I wrote adult toy reviews, I also wrote about my sexual intercourse experiences, I drew male genital in order to explain some things better. Of course, my blog was never approved. I was also told 'Amazon affiliate program' could possibly be a tool for monetising. So I tried to sell contraception kit, such as condom. Because... It was xes-friendly blog. No one bought from my link. So $0.00.

 I used my previous blog as a tool of venting my anger, a drainage of excessive emotion, an expedient of seeking/getting attention. Hence I thought that not making money isn't important. In fact, I thought that It's okay to spend around $300.00 a year for my hobby. Now I'm using github *free* hosting, as well as trying to write every post at the very least sexual if you already noticed. I don't even write ~~sex~~, I write 'xes' instead. Because everyone wants to make money while they do what they like. I don't want to get paid less than [$10.00](https://shiori-fujino.github.io/Handy-Woman#$10.00) per hour with chronic knee pain. One day, I would love to say
 > I'm a writer, I'm doing Uber for extra.

 <h3>Back to monetising</h3>
 Now I don't have many thirsty guys, who visit my blog regularly, to enjoy

 - free naked selfies
 - boldly written xes journals
 - stir the pot.


 That means I have to lure readers without cheating...~~(without nude)~~
