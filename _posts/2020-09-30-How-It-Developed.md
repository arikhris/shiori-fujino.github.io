title: How It Developed
---

TL;DR: Fake Uber, Fake WordPress, Fake iOS, Fake MacOS, you can make anything with open source and You can attack the most vulnerable person because.. I don't know why it has to be me. Let's figure it out.

---

<h4>What do human need for living?</h3>
I needed a car. I have a nice motorbike but I can't use it for moving in and out.
I only mentioned once, "It'd be better if I had a car." Ex-Housemate said,

>There's a company that rent a car on the condition of driving Uber.

So I googled *Rent car Uber* and found **Splend**. That was a month ago.


<h4>What would be a MUST for human life?</h4>

Water, Oxygen, Internet, Computer, Love and Another human to love. Not so much when it comes to transportation especially if I own one already.
A month before I was happy riding motorbike, though, as soon as I got approved my application for my new place I wanted to move out by myself without anyone's help hence, I needed a car.
I could just hire a car a day or two for moving but I had my excuse. I didn't want to rush. That's it btw.  
Plus, I had a problem on getting ABN(for Uber) because there was a *system error* that no one knows why(So I went to ATO), and Register GST(for Uber) was crazy difficult and complicated. I have been through a bumpy month, therefore, I MUST OBTAIN THIS FREAKIN CAR.

I could understand why it's VERY clumsy to get an activated Uber driver partner account because It's as getting a job without interview, so there should be strict rules and regulations to follow. A lots of paperworks and validation process. Super Awkward when I was required to take a selfie with holding driver license in left hand. Will they refuse me if I'm ugly?

Expectedly, I got refused uncountable times because of this and that, one time I got approved everything but refused one thing, another time got approved another thing, but got rejected an other thing and repeat many times. I had so many questions to ask.

- Why I am registered as UberEats delivery in Perth? I was asking Uber driver partner in Sydney.
- Why there's typo in Uber driver app such as *Sign0up* instead of *Sign-up*?
- Why **HELP** staffs are rude like I want to punch on their face? I don't usually think that way because my previous job was similar to what they do. I always try my best to respect them. I mean.. why not so professional?
- Why is it so hard to be connected with agents in first place?
- Why *Deryljean* runs away like that? Should I answer him(her) in 59seconds?

<h4> Uber is well-known, huge international company, isn't it? But what are those flaws?</h4>

But I couldn't do anything about it. Uber's *Greenlight Hub* was closed due to Covid-19, All I could do was just wait. One day I google-mapped Uber, and it showed me Uber Melbourne. Usually... It shows the local one or the closest one but why do I get Melbourne result? I mean... Everything seemed so puzzled. I was registered in Perth UberEats and Google map showed me Melbourne Greenlight Hub But I AM IN SYDNEY. I even went to Greenlight Hub on Parramatta road in Sydney to check if it's REALLY closed. mmm... It is really closed.

While I was waiting, I found a forum for Uber drivers. It's called *Uber people*. While I was reading few threads, I found my greatest fear and it triggered me badly.

![666](image/uberguy666.png)

I mentioned about **Cyber bully** in my last post. There was a guy who bullied me for about half year, The reason for haunting me to death was because I rejected him. As I said I had very promiscuous *xes* life and I was ready to *kcuf* literally anyone and I did, except hayabi666(the bully). I don't know why, I just didn't feel like it, and then he started to attack me from every side of my life especially my 5 years old beloved blog.


I even closed my precious, my everything, my one and only blog because of him. People told me to ignore him and in order to ignore him, I had to close my blog. Otherwise He would comment on every single post until I kill myself. Some people even said I would've given him a chance at least once because look at his dedication, He literally hit on me every day and night for more than 6 month. It creeped me out.

From 666, I started tripping out. It didn't seem my *Uber Driver* app is legitimate. I also read about

- Uber hacking by using promo code (I only gave my promocode ONCE to my Ex-housemate.)
- Uber restAPI from GitHub
- Open source iOS apps from Github
- Open source MacOS apps from Github

In not-so-much-thch-person's head: If someone knows how to use API and open source kind of komputa, programming, coding stuff, (S)He can make fake Uber, or any other apps and steal my privacy, private information include my ABN, Driver license, Passport, Criminal record and Birth certificate etc., I even had to take a selfie with one hand holding my driver license.

I was pissed. Someone could intentionally have made it to steal people’s(or My) information.

I was pissed but at the same time I was scared. I had a blog hosted by WordPress for 5 years. There also was open source for Wordpress.
It sounded like WordPress that installed in my iPhone, iPad, Macbook also were fake.
When I was locked in bedlam, I gave my blog URL(Shiori-fujino.com) to Alex(Ward-mate) to check out. He said It forwards(redirects) to another random website and I thought that's weird. But soon after I forgot about it. Also, I kept getting emails from google analystic, It says the blog has a problem. I didn't care much because It worked well in my devices.

It worked well **ONLY** in my devices. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

While I was panicking, I installed Chrome the browser.
I wondered why Chrome and Firefox aren’t in AppStore. Why there's Duckduckgo but no Chrome and Firefox? Duckduckgo also is made of open source so It could always be fake, right? Then I thought, maybe Google hates Apple because they are rivals. I know I'm not a logical person. It's dangerous when non-logical person gets paranoid. I cried whole 2 or 3 days because all I read from internet, mostly Wikipedia, which I shouldn't trust much, I COUDN'T UNDERSTAND. Even in my mother language I was not able to interpret it in my head. I was frustrated. Back to browser, I googled *Chrome* and downloaded it from unknown random link. I have a panic-habit. I read all **terms and conditions**, or **Terms of Use**, I click all **About xyz**(For instance, About Atom, About Safari, Abour Instruments, About Chrome), **Acknowledgement** and It helps me to get panicked and paranoid even more. Again, back to browser, It was not Chrome, It was Chromium. What on the earth is Chromium? I asked Chrome, not Chromium.

I felt like it's deja-vu, It was exactly same feeling. Same feeling that I sensed just before I got arrested from suicidal attempt. (I was literally, 4-5 cops came to my place and I couldn't do anything other than crying. So dumb) I was trapped, There's no way I could escape, or run away. To end this open source life, I must have killed myself. I couldn't stop crying because it's sad to end life because of something or someone not my will. I have never married and never met OK guy in my life. All guys I met and dated are dickheads otherwise retards. And think about my parents. They have only me, I never made them happy. After I am gone my mom and dad will be 10 times more depressed than I was. Freaking Netflix was kept being cancelled and that was my biggest concern before break my skull.

My hypothesis was simple. Uber driver app is fake.
If uberdriverapp was fake, in order to install fake app in my iPhone, my iPhone should be jailbroken. If so, how did my phone jailbreak itself?
I looked up information that I never understand days and nights.
I was living the edge, between live and not to live. I changed my mind 100 times a day between

- Let's finish this.
- Let's find out how it happened. What it is.

But one thing was sure. This time I won't be locked in a ward. I have to plan everything properly.

At last, my account got finally approved a week ago, and I’m driving Hyundai Kona like nothing happened. With Kona I moved out well and moved in nicely. I bought 30kg queen mattress and moved by myself (Proud of myself, I am an independent single lady) I love my new place, It's nice area, I like The entire wall made of window. I also like along side river and neighbours are awesome.

<h4>Now, I have the most of basic needs of human being.</h4>
Nice shelter, Washing machine, Fridge, Vacuum, Bed, Lamps, Uber driver account, iMac, Macbook, iPhone, iPad, Magic mouse and Magic keyboard.
I bought an expensive perfume, I felt like some extra after I satisfied my basic needs. I smell like princess. I wear ragged jumper that I bought in Hawaii 3 years ago, and I have tangled big bun on my head but I smell like princess.
I always wondered why my mom wears nice perfume before she goes to bed. She still wears it even she sleeps alone. Now I can understand why. Because good smell makes hooman happy. Good smell reminds me of my mom. I decided to solve this issues rather than end it forcefully, maybe I will never able to, but I'll try at least. Because I smell like princess now and Maybe I miss my mom a bit.
